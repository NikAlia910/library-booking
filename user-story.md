Here's a user story based on the "library booking system" project description and the provided template:

**Title**: Book a Resource (e.g., Book, Room)
**As a** Library Patron
**I want** to be able to reserve a resource (book, meeting room, etc.) online
**So that** I can ensure the resource is available when I need it and avoid unnecessary trips to the library.

**Business Logic**:

- Password requires a minimum of 8 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.
- A patron can only have a maximum of 5 active reservations at any given time.
- Reservations can be made up to 30 days in advance.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1.  I can search for available resources by title, author, keyword, or resource type.
2.  I can view the availability calendar for a specific resource to see when it is already booked.
3.  I can select a date and time slot for my reservation, provided it is available and within the allowed booking window.
4.  I receive a confirmation email with the details of my reservation, including the resource name, date, time, and reservation ID.
5.  The system prevents me from booking a resource if I have already reached my maximum reservation limit.
6.  The system prevents me from booking a resource if the selected time slot overlaps with an existing reservation.

**Functional Requirements**:

- The system must allow patrons to search for resources.
- The system must display the availability of each resource.
- The system must allow patrons to select a date and time for their reservation.
- The system must send a confirmation email to the patron upon successful reservation.
- The system must enforce the maximum reservation limit per patron.
- The system must prevent overlapping reservations.

**Non-Functional Requirements**:

- The system must be responsive and accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
- The system must be secure and protect patron data.
- The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent users.
- The system must have a response time of less than 3 seconds for all user actions.

**UI Design**:

- The search interface should be clear and intuitive, with prominent search fields and filters.
- The availability calendar should be easy to read and understand, with clear visual cues for available and unavailable time slots.
- The reservation confirmation page should display all relevant reservation details in a clear and concise manner.
- The UI should adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to ensure usability for all patrons.
